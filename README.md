## Tech Tinkerer's Twitter

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

[![Deploy with Vercel](https://vercel.com/button)](https://vercel.com/new/git/external?repository-url=https://github.com/jasperchess/tech-tinkerers-twitter)

## Setup

Make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed on your machine. Then run the following command to install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Rename the `.env.example` file to `.env` and fill in your name and get the `DATABASE_URL` from our Slack.

### Alternative to TypeScript

If you are not comfortable with TypeScript, you can use the JavaScript version of the template. For this, change all the `.tsx` extensions to `.jsx`.

## Development

To start the development server, run the following command:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the template.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
